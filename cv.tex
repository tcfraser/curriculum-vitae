            Research in quantum foundations studying quantum non-locality from the perspective of causal inference. Discovered new causal compatibility inequalities leading to a better understanding of quantum information resources. Computationally simulated six-entangled qubits and associated measurements to find new entanglement resources. Invented new computational techniques for solving the marginal satisfiability problem capable of out-performing existing methods when large computational networks are required.
